GLOBAL CHANGES FOR THE TOMODS CONVERTERS
+ The current programs add an underscore and the reference count to the
  reference id by default.  This is changed so that it only occurs when
  requested using the new -a or --add-refcount flags.
+ Fixed bug where the reference count wasn't used when outputting individual
  files for each reference.  This is, of course, dependent on the -a
  or --add-refcount flags.
+ change --verbose flag to only output warnings
+ add --debug flag for full output useful in hunting down problems
+ Major rewrite of the converters:
     Common framework is in lib/tomods.c
     Variables and unique function pointers defined by struct convert_rules
     Must define readf() to read a single reference from a file
     Must define processf() to convert raw input into tag/data/level in a
         field using native tags
     Define cleanf() or set to NULL to define function to clean up data
         such as LaTeX codes
     Must define convertf() to convert native tag/data/level elements into
         those appropriate for MODS XML output.
